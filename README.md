# matlab_simulated_annealing
Implementation of a simple simulated annealing with multiple variables
Works quite well functions with numerous local maximas and minimas.

The code allows for:
   -multiple variables (currently maximum of 10, if needed more need to manually add to anneal.m , in function calculate_cost)
   -define your own random step function
   -define your own cost function
   -define your own plotting function
   -save the process into a GIF
   -etc...
   
See the examples folder for more. (Remember to add src -folder to path when running the examples)
